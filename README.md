# VDM++ ATM Model

This repository contains a VDM++ (Vienna Development Method) model for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system along with its implementation in C++.

## Overview

The VDM++ ATM model is designed to represent the behavior and structure of an Automated Teller Machine. It includes specifications for card handling, PIN verification, balance management, and transaction processing. The corresponding C++ implementation follows the VDM++ specifications, providing a concrete representation of the ATM system.

## Contents

- `vdm_model/`: Contains the VDM++ specifications for the ATM model.
- `cpp_implementation/`: Includes the C++ source code implementing the ATM system.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading.

## VDM++ Model

The VDM++ model provides a high-level description of the ATM system's functionalities, emphasizing its behavior, and structure. The specifications are written in VDM++ language, allowing for formal verification and validation of the system.

## C++ Implementation

The C++ implementation takes the VDM++ model and translates it into executable code. It includes classes and functions that represent the key components of the ATM system, such as the card, PIN verification, balance management, and transaction processing.
